# Data Warehousing and Mart Creation with dbt

# Project Overview
This project aims to streamline reporting and database querying for Business Intelligence (BI) analysts by implementing a comprehensive data warehousing solution. Leveraging the power of dbt (data build tool), we transform an OLTP flat file into dimensional tables, creating a structured environment that facilitates efficient data analysis and decision-making.


# Objectives

To create a centralized data warehouse and department-specific data marts within a PostgreSQL database.

To optimize the data structure for enhanced reporting and querying by BI analysts.

To utilize dbt for effective transformation of flat file data into a well-organized dimensional model.


# Key Features

Data Lake Creation: An initial staging area where raw data is stored before transformation.

Data Warehouse: A centralized repository that consolidates data from various sources into a coherent framework.

Analytical Layers: Specialized structures designed to support advanced data analysis and reporting.

ERD Diagrams: Utilization of draw.io to create Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) for dimensional tables, aiding in the visualization of data relationships.
